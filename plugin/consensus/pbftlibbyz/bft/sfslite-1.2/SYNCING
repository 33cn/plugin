When Syncing from SFS to SFSlite: A Checklist
---------------------------------------------
 - acinclude.m4
    - copy over SFS_TAG macro
    - ditto for SFS_MMAP and INSTALL_C
    - ditto for SFS_TUTORIAL
    - ditto for SFS_GMP
 - configure.in
    - copy block of code from begin sfslite to end sfslite
    - meaning, we need new rules for sfsincludedir, sfslibdir, etc, that
      contain mention of the SFS tag.
    - also make sure the m4 macro SFS_TAG is being called from here.
    - dnl the SFS_CHECK_NFSMNT macro
    - dnl the SFS_USER macro
    - prune the AC_OUTPUT list, and add the tutorial conditional build, too
    - delete all berkeley DB stuff
 - Makefile.am
    - David usually doesn't update this; Needs a bunch of syncs.
 - async/Makefile.am
    - change sfsexec_PROGRAMS to contain mmcd
    - add litetime.C to libasync_la_SOURCES
    - add litetime.h to sfsinclude_HEADERS
    - add mmcd_SOURCES, mmcd_LDADD, and mmcd_DEPENDENCIES
    - remove if STATIC lines for different compiling aiod for
      shared libraries.  was breaking builds under gcc 3.4
 - async/core.C
    - add #include "litetime.h"
    - s/clock_gettime (a,b)/my_clock_gettime ($b)/g
 - async/
    - add mmcd.c, litetime.[Ch]
 - async/async.h
    - add #include "litetime.h"
    - update SFS_PATCHLEVEL #defines
 - rpcc/Makefile.am
    - delete dependency of scan.o on parse.h
 - crypt/Makefile.am
    - remove if STATIC lines for different compiling tst for
      shared libraries.  was breaking builds under gcc 3.4
