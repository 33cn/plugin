How To Update the FreeBSD Port
------------------------------
0. cp -r sfslite sfslite.orig
1. Change the Makefile to reflect new version
2. Change pkg-plist if there are new files, etc.
3. Run 'make makesum' to make a new checksum file.
4. cd /usr/port; diff -u devel/sfslite.orig devel/sfslite > /tmp/sfslite-patch
5. run 'send-pr' with Category:ports and Class:maintainter-upgrade
6. Attach the patch as the body of the PR
7. send

Note the other two ports don't need to be upgraded, since they mainly
point to the main port.
