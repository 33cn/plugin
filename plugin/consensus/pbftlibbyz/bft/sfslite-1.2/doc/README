Automatic Manpage Generation
----------------------------

Manpages are generated via manpager.pl in the directory.  It takes
as input sfs.texi and output a series of manpages for the various
commands therein.  

manpager.pl understands the following native texi commands:

	- Document Sectioning: @table, @item, @itemx, @itemize, 
		@example, @diplay

	- Character Formatting: @command, @file, @option, @var,
		@samp, @env, @strong

	- Linking and Referencing: @xref, @uref, @ref


manpager.pl ignores the following commands within its auspices:

	@cindex, @anchor, @table, @noident, @cindex


manpager.pl needs the following commands in the sfs.tex file to 
understand how to break the file up into separate files, and how
to section those given files:

	@c @mp 
	@c @mp @end
		
		Manpager will only read contents of the input file
		between these two commands.  Hence, most of the
		the input file will be ignore except where otherwise
		indicated


	@c @mp @command{<name>}{<desc>}{<section>}
	@c @mp @end commands

		Denotes a command in the input file.  The given parameters
		are for the name of the command, a short description
		of the command, and the manual section of the 
		command, respectively.  Should contain other
		subsection commands such as synopsis, description,
		options, and so on.

	@c @mp @conffile{<name>}{<desc>}
	@c @mp @end conffile

		As above but for a configuration file.  Note that the
		man section of configuration files is by default 5.

	@c @mp @<subsection>
	@c @mp @end <subsection>

		Where <subsection> is one of synopsis, description,
		options, or bugs.  This is used to indicated a subsection
		of a manual page.

	@c @mp @ingore
	@c @mp @end ignore

		Ignore all text between these two markers.

	@c @mpp <text>

		Manpager pass-through.  <text> will be used only in
		the generation of manpages.

	@c @mp @indent
	@c @mp @end indent
	
		Move all text between these markers over one indent.
		These commands are roughly synonymous with the texi
		commands for @table and @end table.
